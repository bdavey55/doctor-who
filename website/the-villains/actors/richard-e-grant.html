      <h1>Richard E. Grant</h1>
      <p><strong>Richard E. Grant</strong> (born <strong>Richard Grant Esterhuysen</strong>;,[1][2] 5 May 1957) is a British actor, screenwriter, and director.[3] He came to public attention in 1987 for playing Withnail in the film <em>Withnail and I</em>, and achieved international recognition as John Seward in the 1992 blockbuster <em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em>.</p>
      <p>Grant was a member of the Space Theatre Company in Cape Town before moving to London in 1982. He later stated, "I grew up in Swaziland when it was mired in a 1960s sensibility. The kind of English spoken where I grew up was a period English sound and when I came to England people said, 'how strange'. Charles Sturridge, who directed <em>Brideshead Revisited</em> for TV, said, 'you speak English like someone from the 1950s'."[11]</p>
      <p>Grant's first film role was the perpetually inebriated title character in <em>Withnail and I</em>, which has established a large cult following. Following his film <em>Withnail and I</em>, Grant began appearing in Hollywood films, and quickly established himself as a powerful character actor in a wide array of films, from blockbuster studio movies to small independent projects. Over the past twenty years, Grant has had strong supporting roles in the films<em>Henry &amp; June</em>, <em>L.A. Story</em>, <em>The Player</em>, <em>The Age of Innocence</em>, <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, <em>Spice World</em>, <em>Gosford Park</em>, <em>Bright Young Things</em>, and <em>Penelope</em>.</p>
      <p>Grant has twice portrayed the Doctor from <em>Doctor Who</em>, both outside the main continuity. In the comedy sketch <em>Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death</em>, he portrayed a version of the Tenth Doctor, referred to as the Quite Handsome Doctor. He also voiced a version of the Ninth Doctor for the BBC original animated webcast <em>Scream of the Shalka</em>. The latter had intended to be the official Ninth Doctor prior the revival of the TV series. In August, 2012, the BBC announced that Grant would join the cast of <em>Doctor Who</em> for "The Snowmen", in which he plays a villain, Dr. Walter Simeon.[12] He appeared again in the following episode, "The Bells of Saint John" as the <a href="../characters/the-great-intelligence.html">Great Intelligence</a>, one of the Second Doctor's most infamous villains and, prior to "The Snowmen" (played by Ian McKellen), was last seen in <em>The Abominable Snowmen</em> and <em>The Web of Fear</em>. Grant reprises the role in the series 7 finale, "The Name of the Doctor".</p>

      <p>On 22 November 2007, he gave a keynote speech at North London Collegiate School in North London as part of their Performing Arts Centre Opening Festival,[15] and presented the 2008 Laurence Olivier Awards.[16]</p>
