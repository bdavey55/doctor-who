      <h1>Sontarans</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Sontarans</strong> are a fictional extraterrestrial race of humanoids from the British science fiction television series <em>Doctor Who</em>, and also seen in spin-off series <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em>. A warrior race who "live to kill", they are characterised by their ruthlessness and fearlessness of death. They were created by writer Robert Holmes.</p>
      <p>The Sontarans (pronounced <em>son-TAR-ans</em>) [note 1] are a race of humanoids with a stocky build, greenish brown skin, and a distinctive dome-shaped head. In addition, they have only three fingers on each hand. Their special muscles are designed for load-bearing rather than leverage because of the significant amount of gravity on their home planet of Sontar. Ross Jenkins in "The Sontaran Stratagem" describes a Sontaran as resembling "a talking baked potato". Sontarans come from a large, dense planet named Sontar in the "southern spiral arm of the galaxy" which has a very strong gravitational field, which explains their compact stocky form.[1] They also are far stronger than humans and in the recent series are shorter than the average human male.</p>
      <p>The Sontarans have an extremely militaristic and war based culture; every aspect of their society is geared toward warfare, and every experience is viewed in terms of its martial relevance. In <em>The Sontaran Experiment</em>, the Fourth Doctor comments that "Sontarans never do anything without a military reason." In fact, to die heroically in battle is their ultimate goal. Aside from a ritualistic chant in "The Sontaran Strategem"/"The Poison Sky", they are never seen to engage in any activity that would be considered recreation, though a few offhand comments by Commander Skorr in "The Poison Sky" suggest they do consider hunting a sport (according to their creator Robert Holmes, Sontarans do have a highly developed artistic culture, but have put it on hold for the duration of the war, while the opening chapter of the novelisation of <em>The Time Warrior</em>, based on Holmes' incomplete draft, refers to Linx listening to the Sontaran anthem while his spaceship is in flight).</p>

      <p>The Sontarans depicted in the series have detached, smug personalities, and a highly developed sense of honour; on multiple occasions, the Doctor has used his knowledge of their pride in their species to manipulate them. However, in "The Sontaran Stratagem", the Doctor nevertheless referred to them as "the finest soldiers in the galaxy".</p>
