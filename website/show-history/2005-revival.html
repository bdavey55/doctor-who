      <h3><span id="40th_Anniversary_Doctor">40th Anniversary Doctor</span></h3>
      <p>However, Salmon's successor, Lorraine Heggessey, proved to be equally enthusiastic about the idea of new <em>Doctor Who</em>, often commenting to the press that she would like to pursue the idea but that "rights difficulties" – presumably BBC Worldwide's film negotiations – prevented it. Equally positive comments were made by the Corporation's overall Head of Drama, Jane Tranter. Heggessey had received several new series proposals since she had taken over control of BBC One, the highest-profile being from producer Dan Freedman – who had produced a full-cast, official, audio <em>Doctor Who</em> story, entitled <em>Death Comes to Time</em>, for the BBCi website in 2001. Another came from actor/writer Mark Gatiss, who in 2002 drew up and submitted a proposal in collaboration with writer Gareth Roberts and then <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em> editor Clayton Hickman.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, BBCi, the interactive media arm of the corporation, who had scored successes with their <em>Doctor Who</em> webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned <em>Death Comes to Time</em>, which was followed by<em>Real Time</em> in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted <em>Shada</em> in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme's upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBCi announced the production of<em>Scream of the Shalka</em>, a fully animated adventure adapted for webcasting with Richard E. Grant as the Doctor and Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBCi announced <em>Shalka</em> as the "official" continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the "official" Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that.</p>
      <h3><span id="Ninth_Doctor">Ninth Doctor</span></h3>
      <p>In September 2003, Heggessey managed to persuade Worldwide that as several years had now passed and they were no nearer to producing a film, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. The other proposals notwithstanding, Tranter and Heggessey elected to approach Davies once again, who had often told the BBC when approached for other projects that he would only return to them to take charge of a new series of <em>Doctor Who</em>. He quickly accepted, and on 26 September 2003 it was officially announced that <em>Doctor Who</em> would be returning to BBC One, produced in-house at BBC Wales in 2004 for transmission in 2005.</p>
      <p>Davies was made the chief writer and Executive Producer of the new series (called Series One instead of continuing the numbering with Season 27, although the narrative thread continued from the old series rather than starting afresh), and other writers included Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat, Paul Cornell and Rob Shearman. The Producer was Phil Collinson and the other Executive Producers were Mal Young (although he subsequently left the BBC midway through production at the end of 2004), and BBC Wales Head of Drama, Julie Gardner. A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of Cardiff as the base for filming the series was the result of a combination of factors. She and Davies, who had worked together on the BBC drama series <em>Casanova</em> starring David Tennant, were both from Wales; the BBC was looking to move more of its productions away from London; and there was a good variety of filming locations in the area.</p>
      <p>The new series would comprise thirteen 45-minute long episodes, with the first story titled "Rose" after the Doctor's new companion Rose Tyler. Unlike past seasons which used serial-style storytelling, the new series would have mainly standalone or two-part episodes. Filming of the first season began in Cardiff on 18 July 2004. With the new series confirmed, when <em>Shalka</em> was webcast in November 2003, the further adventures of Grant's Ninth Doctor were in doubt. In February 2004, plans for sequels to <em>Shalka</em> were indefinitely shelved, although Grant's version of the character, now dubbed the "Shalka Doctor", would return in a short story entitled "The Feast of the Stone" published on the BBC website.</p>
      <p>After much speculation in the press about possible candidates, BBC announced that Christopher Eccleston would be the Ninth Doctor, accompanied by former pop singer Billie Piper as Rose. In the April 2004 issue of <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em>, Davies announced that Eccleston's Doctor would indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant's Ninth Doctor to non-official status.</p>
      <p>In April 2004, Michael Grade returned to the BBC, this time as the Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he was quoted as being generally indifferent to the new series, he eventually wrote an e-mail to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, "I never dreamed I would ever write this. I must be going soft!"</p>
      <p>However, not everyone was pleased with the new production. Some fans criticised the new logo and perceived changes to the TARDIS model.[21] According to various news sources, members of the production team even received hate mail and death threats.The new logo and trailers were posted on the BBC website and were followed up by television spots in March 2005 with a media blitz in the run up to the transmission of "Rose" on 26 March. An employee of a third party company associated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation leaked a rough cut of the premiere on the internet; the leak attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans. Advance reviews in the British media were generally positive.</p>
      <p>"Rose" finally saw transmission on on 26 March at 7 pm on BBC One, the first regular episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> for over 15 years. To complement the series, BBC Wales also produced <em>Doctor Who Confidential</em>, a 13-part documentary series with each episode broadcast on BBC Three immediately after the end of the weekly instalment on BBC One. "Rose" received average overnight ratings of 9.9 million viewers, peaking at 10.5 million.The final figure for the episode, including video recordings watched within a week of transmission, was 10.81 million, No. 3 for BBC One that week and No. 7 across all channels. The success of the launch saw the BBC's Head of Drama Jane Tranter confirming on 30 March that the series would return both for a Christmas Special in December 2005 and a full second series in 2006.</p>
      <p>The series was well received by both critics and the public. The 2005 TV Choice/TV Quick Award went to Eccleston for Best Actor, and <em>Doctor Who</em> was nominated for Best Series. Eccleston, Piper, and <em>Doctor Who</em>were all winners in their categories at the UK's National Television Awards, announced on 25 October 2005. Although not as prestigious as the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), they are the highest-profile UK television awards voted on by members of the public[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2007)">citation needed</span></em>]. The series did go on to win two BAFTA awards in May, including the Best Drama Series category.</p>
      <p>Due to an initial lack of interest by networks in the United States, <em>Doctor Who</em> debuted on the Sci Fi Channel on 17 March 2006, one year after the Canadian and UK showings.</p>
      <p>Although the new series clearly continues the storyline of the original – with Eccleston identified in publicity materials as the Ninth Doctor, and the appearance of original series elements such as UNIT and Sarah-Jane Smith—the BBC is officially treating the series as a new programme, calling the 2005 season "Series 1". This has led to controversy between fans who wish to follow the BBC's numbering and those who consider the 2005 series to be Season 27 (and so on).</p>
      <p>Concurrent with the new series, BBC Books revamped its line of <em>Doctor Who</em> original fiction, retiring for now its Eighth Doctor and Past Doctor paperback line (the last such volume appearing in late 2005) and launching a new series of hardback novels featuring the Ninth and, later, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors (see New Series Adventures).</p>
      <h3><span id="Tenth_Doctor">Tenth Doctor</span></h3>
      <p>Mere hours after the announcement of a second series, tabloid newspapers <em>The Sun</em> and the <em>Daily Express</em> announced "exclusive" news that Eccleston had quit the series. Eccleston then apparently released a statement through the BBC, saying that he would be leaving the role at Christmas for fear of being typecast.</p>
      <p>Fan reaction to the news ranged from disappointment to irritation to outright anger. Some did point out, however, that the series is uniquely suited to deal with cast changes. The number of angry postings on the popular <em>Outpost Gallifrey</em> fan forum was enough for Shaun Lyon, the owner of the website, to close down the forum for two days to allow tempers to cool.</p>
      <p>Speculation arose as to how long the production team had been aware of Eccleston's decision. Eventually, it transpired that the departure had been planned and the scripts written to accommodate Eccleston's departure, but it was not meant to have been announced until after the first series had concluded.The BBC admitted that they had falsely attributed Eccleston's "statement" and released it in violation of an earlier agreement not to reveal his departure publicly. The statement had been made after journalists made queries to the press office.</p>
      <p>On 16 April 2005, the BBC confirmed that David Tennant would be the Tenth Doctor. The regeneration from Eccleston to Tennant took place in "The Parting of the Ways", the season finale. Tennant and Piper next starred in a 7-minute mini-episode for Children in Need. Tennant's first full story as the Doctor was the 2005 Christmas special, "The Christmas Invasion", and Piper joined him for the whole of Series 2.</p>
      <p>At a BAFTA screening of "The Parting of the Ways", the finale of the 2005 series, on 15 June 2005, Jane Tranter announced that both a second seasonal episode (later titled "The Runaway Bride") and third series of<em>Doctor Who</em> had been commissioned. Piper left the programme at the end of Series 2, and a new companion, Martha Jones (played by Freema Agyeman), joined Tennant at the start of Series 3 on 31 March 2007.</p>
      <p>Series 2 aired in the UK and US in 2006, and finished airing in Canada on 12 February 2007. The third series aired in the UK in the spring of 2007 and began airing in Canada and the US during the summer of that year. A 2007 Christmas Special "Voyage of the Damned" was broadcast on 25 December 2007 in the UK, featuring Kylie Minogue as a waitress named Astrid.</p>
      <p>The fourth series aired in the UK in 2008 featuring two companions; Donna Noble, who first appeared in "The Runaway Bride" and Martha Jones, who returned to the series for five episodes of series four. Billie Piper also returned to the show to reprise her original role as Rose Tyler.</p>
      <p>Following broadcast of the third series, the BBC announced that the show would not return as a weekly series in 2009, due to a number of factors. Instead, four specials would be broadcast in 2009, with a full series returning in 2010. It was later announced that when the full series returned in 2010, Tennant would no longer be the Doctor. Playing the role would be the 26-year-old actor Matt Smith.</p>
      <p>The return of <em>Doctor Who</em> has led to the BBC launching a number of spin-offs and related programmes. The first of these was the behind-the-scenes series <em>Doctor Who Confidential</em> which began airing on BBC Threein conjunction with the 2005 series and returned for a new set of episodes in 2006; each episode focuses on elements of that week's <em>Doctor Who</em> episode, and the series has continued alongside all stories since 2005. In 2006, the first full <em>Doctor Who</em> spin-off series, <em>Torchwood</em>, debuted on BBC Three; it did not air in the United States until BBC America debuted it in September 2007, while the Canadian CBC aired it in October 2007. A second behind-the-scenes series, <em>Totally Doctor Who</em>, which aired on BBC One, also debuted in 2006. After the appearance of Sarah Jane Smith in the 2006 episode "School Reunion", it was announced that Elisabeth Sladen would reprise the role in a new series entitled <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em>, the first episode of which aired on BBC One on 1 January 2007, followed by its debut as a weekly series in September 2007. Following Sladen's death, the programme came to an end after its fifth series in autumn 2011. Yet another spin-off series, <em>K-9</em>, was announced for 2007, but this series is not being produced by the BBC. In addition, Tennant and Agyeman provided voice acting work for <em>The Infinite Quest</em>, an animated serial that aired as part of the 2007 series of <em>Totally Doctor Who</em>.</p>
