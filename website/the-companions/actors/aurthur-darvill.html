      <p><strong>Thomas Arthur Darvill</strong> (born 17 June 1982) is an English actor and singer, known professionally as <strong>Arthur Darvill</strong>. He is noted for his work in the plays <em>Terre Haute</em>(2006) and <em>Swimming with Sharks</em> (2007), but is best known for his role as <a href="../characters/rory-williams.html">Rory Williams</a>, one of the Eleventh Doctor's companions in the television series <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>
      
      <div id="toc">
      <p>Darvill began playing Rory Williams, companion to the Eleventh Doctor, in the fifth series of the BBC's science fiction show <em>Doctor Who</em> (reuniting with his <em>Swimming with Sharks</em> co-star Matt Smith). He became a regular character in the sixth series, and confirmed that he would be appearing in the seventh series; however, the seventh series was his last. His character, along with Amy, was written out of the show midway through Series 7; they were separated from the Doctor forever by the Weeping Angels in "The Angels Take Manhattan".</p>
      <p>Darvill had a minor role as a stable groom in Ridley Scott's <em>Robin Hood</em>, and played Mick Gallagher in <em>Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll</em>. In summer 2011, he appeared in <em>Doctor Faustus</em> at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London.  After his departure from <em>Doctor Who</em> he was cast in the highly-rated crime drama <em>Broadchurch</em> as the vicar, alongside former <em>Doctor Who</em> stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman.</p>
      <h3><span id="Other_work">Other work</span></h3>
      <p>Darvill is also a musician and composer; he has written songs and music for the Bush Theatre, and composed the score for Che Walker's 2008 play <em>The Frontline</em>at Shakespeare's Globe. In June 2009, the musical <em>Been So Long</em>, based on Ché Walker's 1998 play, opened at the Young Vic and in September 2013 another collaboration, <em>The Lightning Child</em>, opened at the Globe. Darvill had worked with Walker for a number of years since they had first met at RADA, developing the songs and music for the show. The musical was performed at the Latitude Festival in July and had a run at the Traverse Theatre in August. Darvill received a Judge's Discretionary Award from MTM for his music. In 2010, Darvill helped promote the solo album of Fyfe Dangerfield, playing with him on sessions forGraham Norton's show and on Xfm.</p>
      <p>Darvill has undertaken a number of radio and voice projects, including <em>Doctor Who</em> audiobooks. In December 2011, he played Keith Moon for BBC Radio 4's <em>Burning Both Ends</em>. In 2012, he voiced Gulliver in Radio 4's <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> and Sam in the short film <em>Penguin</em>.</p>
      <p>He gave an interview and appeared on the front cover of the October 2012 issue of Gay Times.</p>
      <p>On 19 April 2013 he took over the lead male role of Guy from the musical Once, on Broadway, New York opposite new co-star Joanna Christie. The two also made an appearance on the 2013 Tony Awards to perform a number and to present the award for best scenery Darvill continued the role in the West End production from 17 March 2014 until 10 May 2014.</p>
