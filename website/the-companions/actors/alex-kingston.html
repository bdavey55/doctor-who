Her first appearance was in the premiere of the fourth season which was the award-winning live episode "Ambush" where she portrayed British surgeon, Elizabeth Corday. Kingston played this role for just over seven seasons until leaving in October 2004, in season 11: episode 4 called "Fear". In spring 2009, Kingston returned to <em>ER</em> during its 15th and final season for two episodes which were season 15: episode 12 called "Dream Runner" and season 15: episode 22 which was the two-hour series finale called "And in the End...".</p>

      <p>In 2008, Kingston guest-starred in the fourth series of the long-running science fiction television programme <em>Doctor Who</em> in the two-part story "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead" as River Song. She reprised the role in several episodes of the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 series. Kingston says she thought her role was simply a one-off, but was delighted that she would be a returning character as she has now appeared in fifteen episodes and counting.</p>
