      <p><strong>Alexandra Elizabeth</strong> "<strong>Alex</strong>" <strong>Kingston</strong> (born 11 March 1963) is an English actress. She is known for her roles as Dr. Elizabeth Corday on the NBC medical drama<em> ER</em> and as <a href="../characters/river-song.html">River Song</a> in the BBC science fiction series <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>
      <p>Kingston has appeared in a number of British-produced television dramas, including <em>Grange Hill</em>, <em>Crocodile Shoes</em>, <em>The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders</em>, <em>The Knock</em> and a guest role on <em>The Bill</em>.</p>
      <p>Kingston's film credits include <em>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover</em> (1989), <em>A Pin for the Butterfly</em> (1994), <em>The Infiltrator</em> (1995), <em>Croupier</em> (1998), <em>Essex Boys</em> (2000),<em>Boudica</em> (<em>Warrior Queen</em> in the USA) (2003) in which she played the eponymous Boudica, <em>Sweet Land</em> (2005) and <em>Crashing</em> (2007).</p>
      <p>In September 1997, Kingston gained North American television fame after being cast on the long-running medical drama <em>ER</em>. Her first appearance was in the premiere of the fourth season which was the award-winning live episode "Ambush" where she portrayed British surgeon, Elizabeth Corday. Kingston played this role for just over seven seasons until leaving in October 2004, in season 11: episode 4 called "Fear". In spring 2009, Kingston returned to <em>ER</em> during its 15th and final season for two episodes which were season 15: episode 12 called "Dream Runner" and season 15: episode 22 which was the two-hour series finale called "And in the End...".</p>
      <p>In November 2005, Kingston guest-starred in the long-running mystery drama <em>Without a Trace</em> in season 4: episode 6 called "Viuda Negra" (Spanish for "black widow"). The episode was directed by Kingston's former<em>ER</em> cast mate Paul McCrane. She played Lucy Costin, one of two wealthy vacationers from the U.S. whose husband is kidnapped by a Mexican street gang on the last night of their honeymoon.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Kingston starred as Nurse Ratched, opposite Christian Slater as Randle Patrick McMurphy, in the Garrick Theatre's West End production of <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>. Kingston revealed that she was turned down for a role on ABC's <em>Desperate Housewives</em>, as Lynette Scavo, for being too curvy. In the same article, she admitted to considering and nearly attempting suicide after her separation from her ex-husband Ralph Fiennes.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Kingston guest-starred in the fourth series of the long-running science fiction television programme <em>Doctor Who</em> in the two-part story "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead" as River Song. She reprised the role in several episodes of the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 series. Kingston says she thought her role was simply a one-off, but was delighted that she would be a returning character as she has now appeared in fifteen episodes and counting.</p>
