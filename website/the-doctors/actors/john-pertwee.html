      <h1>Jon Pertwee</h1>

      <p>In 1969, Pertwee was selected by producer Peter Bryant and story editor Derrick Sherwin to take over as the Doctor from Patrick Troughton in the television series <em>Doctor Who</em>. Pertwee had asked his agent to apply for the role for him and was surprised to find he was already on the shortlist. He was the second choice of the producer; Ron Moody was the first but was unavailable.[13] In a departure from the Doctor's first two incarnations, Pertwee played the character as an active crusader with a penchant for action and fancy clothes, even while the character was exiled on Earth and serving with UNIT. He played the Doctor for five seasons from early 1970 to mid-1974, a longer stint than either of his predecessors in the role, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton, although he appeared in fewer episodes than Hartnell, as the BBC relaxed its shooting schedule from 40+ episodes a season to 25-26.</p>
      <p>In early 1974, Pertwee announced he would step down as the Doctor in order to resume his stage career in <em>The Bedwinner</em>, also citing typecasting in the role as the reason for leaving, though later he would say that the catalyst for his departure was the death of his good friend and co-star Roger Delgado (The Master) and the departures of co-star Katy Manning and producer Barry Letts. His last full-time appearance in the series was in the story <em>Planet of the Spiders</em> in June 1974, and Tom Baker replaced him in the role. Pertwee's tenure in<em>Doctor Who</em> has been praised by <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> critic Dr. Tim Stanley as "the high point of the programme as a serious piece of science-fiction".[2]</p>
      <p>Pertwee later reprised the role in the 20th anniversary story <em>The Five Doctors</em> and the Children in Need story <em>Dimensions In Time</em>, in two radio adventures and on stage in <em>Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure</em>. On 14 April 1971, Pertwee was the subject of Thames Television's <em>This Is Your Life</em>.</p>
