      <h1>Christopher Eccleston</h1>
      <p><img src="../../images/doctor actors/Christopher_Eccleston.jpg" alt="christopher eccleston" width="250" height="250" class="imagerap"></p>
      <p>On 2 April 2004, it was announced that Eccleston was to play the<a href="../characters/the-ninth-doctor.html"> ninth incarnation of the Doctor</a> in the revival of the BBC science fiction television series <em>Doctor Who</em>, which began transmission on 26 March 2005. Eccleston was the first actor to play the role who was born after the series began, albeit by less than three months. On 30 March 2005, the BBC released a statement, ostensibly from Eccleston, saying that he had decided to leave the role after just one series, because he feared becoming typecast. On 4 April 2005, the BBC revealed that Eccleston's "statement" was falsely attributed and released without his consent. The BBC admitted that they had broken an agreement made in January not to disclose publicly that he only intended to do one series. The statement had been made after journalists made queries to the press office.[12]</p>
      <p>On 11 June 2005, during a BBC radio interview, when asked if he had enjoyed working on <em>Doctor Who</em>, Eccleston responded by saying, "Mixed, but that's a long story." Eccleston's reasons for leaving the role continue to be debated in Britain's newspapers: on 4 October 2005 Alan Davies told <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> that Eccleston had been "overworked" by the BBC, and had left the role because he was "exhausted".[13] Ten days later, Eccleston told the <em>Daily Mirror</em> this was not true, and expressed some irritation at Davies for his comments.[14] In a 2010 interview, Eccleston revealed that he left the show because he "didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that the cast and crew had to work in", but that he was proud of having played the role.</p>
