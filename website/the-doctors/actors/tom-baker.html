      <h1>Tom Baker</h1>
      <p>In 1974, Baker took over the role of the Doctor from Jon Pertwee to become <a href="../characters/the-fourth-doctor.html">the Fourth Doctor</a> in the BBC TV series.[1] He was recommended to producer Barry Letts by the BBC's Head of Serials, Bill Slater, who had directed Baker in a <em>Play of the Month</em> production of Shaw's play <em>The Millionairess</em>. Impressed by Baker upon meeting him, Letts was convinced he was right for the part after seeing his performance in <em>The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</em>.[5] Baker was working on a construction site at the time, as acting jobs were scarce. Initially he was dubbed "Boiler Suit Tom" by the media because he had been supplied for a press conference with some old studio set clothes to replace his modest garments.[6]</p>
      <p>Baker quickly made the part his own. As the Fourth Doctor, his eccentric style of dress and speech (particularly his trademark long scarf and fondness for jelly babies) made him an immediately recognisable figure, and he quickly caught the viewing public's imagination. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part. Baker himself suggested many aspects of his Doctor's personality, but the distinctive scarf was created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than was necessary to the knitter, Begonia Pope; Pope knitted all the wool she was given. It was Baker who suggested that he wear the ridiculously long scarf, which he did once it had been shortened a bit to make it more manageable.[7] When John Nathan-Turner took over as producer of <em>Doctor Who</em> in 1980, Tom Baker was infuriated by the changes made to his wardrobe.</p>
      <p>The Doctor played by Tom Baker (1974–81) is often regarded as the most popular of the Doctors. In polls conducted by <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em>, Baker has lost the "Best Doctor" category only three times: once to Sylvester McCoy in 1990, and twice to David Tennant in 2006 and 2009.[8] In a poll published by <em>BBC Homes and Antiques</em> magazine in January 2006, Baker was voted the fourth most eccentric star. He was beaten by Björk, Chris Eubank, and David Icke.[9]</p>
