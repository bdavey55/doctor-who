      <h1>David Tennant</h1>
      <p><em>Doctor Who</em> returned to British screens in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston playing the role of the Ninth Doctor in the first series. Tennant replaced him as of the second series, making his first, brief appearance as the <a href="../characters/the-tenth-doctor.html">Tenth Doctor</a> in the episode "The Parting of the Ways" (2005) at the end of the regeneration scene, and also appeared in a special 7-minute mini-episode shown as part of the 2005 Children in Need appeal, broadcast on 18 November 2005. He began filming the new series of <em>Doctor Who</em> in late July 2005. His first full-length outing as the Doctor was a 60-minute special, "The Christmas Invasion", first broadcast on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant had been formally offered the role of the Doctor during rehearsals for <em>The Quatermass Experiment</em>. Although the casting was not officially announced until later in April,[20] both castmates and crew became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng (Quatermass) changed his first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from "Good to have you back Gordon" to "Good to have you back <em>Doctor</em>" as a deliberate reference.[21]</p>
      <p>Tennant has expressed enthusiasm about fulfilling his childhood dream. He remarked in a radio interview: "Who wouldn't want to be the Doctor? I've even got my own TARDIS!" In 2006, readers of <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em> voted Tennant "Best Doctor" over perennial favourite Tom Baker.[22] In 2007, Tennant's Doctor was voted the "coolest character on UK television" in a <em>Radio Times</em> survey.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2013)">citation needed</span></em>] When Tennant was cast as Eccleston's successor, he had wanted to use his native Scottish accent and become "the first kilted Doctor" according to an interview in the <em>Daily Star</em>, but writer Russell T Davies did not want the Doctor's accent "touring the regions", so he used Estuary English instead.[23] Tennant was able to use his Scottish accent during his time on the series, however, when the Doctor briefly masquerades as "Dr Jamie McCrimmon" of Edinburgh in <em>Tooth and Claw</em> - a nod to the Second Doctor's companion.</p>
      <p>He previously had a small role in the BBC's animated <em>Doctor Who</em> webcast <em>Scream of the Shalka</em>. Not originally cast in the production, Tennant happened to be recording a radio play in a neighbouring studio, and when he discovered what was being recorded next door managed to convince the director to give him a small role. This personal enthusiasm for the series had also been expressed by his participation in several audio plays based on the <em>Doctor Who</em> television series which had been produced by Big Finish Productions, although he did not play the Doctor in any of these productions. His first such role was in the Seventh Doctor audio <em>Colditz</em>, where he played a Nazi lieutenant guard at Colditz Castle. In 2004 Tennant played a lead role in the Big Finish audio play series <em>Dalek Empire III</em> as Galanar, a young man who is given an assignment to discover the secrets of the Daleks. In 2005, he starred in <em>UNIT: The Wasting</em> for Big Finish, recreating his role of Brimmicombe-Wood from a Doctor Who Unbound play, <em>Sympathy for the Devil</em>. In both audio productions Tennant worked alongside Nicholas Courtney, who reprised the character of Sir Alastair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. He also played an unnamed Time Lord in another Doctor Who Unbound play <em>Exile</em>. <em>UNIT: The Wasting</em>, was recorded between Tennant getting the role of the Doctor and it being announced. He played the title role in Big Finish's adaptation of Bryan Talbot's <em>The Adventures of Luther Arkwright</em>(2005). In 2006, he recorded abridged audio books of <em>The Stone Rose</em> by Jacqueline Rayner, <em>The Feast of the Drowned</em> by Stephen Cole and <em>The Resurrection Casket</em> by Justin Richards, for BBC Worldwide.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2013)">citation needed</span></em>]</p>
      <p>He made his directorial debut on the <em>Doctor Who Confidential</em> episode that accompanies Steven Moffat's episode "Blink", entitled "Do You Remember The First Time?", which aired on 9 June 2007. In 2007, Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared with Peter Davison's Fifth Doctorin a <em>Doctor Who</em> special for Children in Need, written by Steven Moffat and entitled "Time Crash". He later performed alongside Davison's daughter, Georgia Moffett (as "Jenny") in the 2008 episode "The Doctor's Daughter".</p>
      <p>Tennant featured as the Doctor in an animated version of <em>Doctor Who</em> for <em>Totally Doctor Who</em>, <em>The Infinite Quest</em>, which aired on CBBC. He also starred as the Doctor in another animated six-part <em>Doctor Who</em> series, <em>Dreamland</em>.[24] Tennant guest starred as the Doctor in a two-part story in <em>Doctor Who</em> spin-off <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em>, broadcast in October 2009.[25] Tennant continued to play the Tenth Doctor into the revived programme's fourth series in 2008. However, on 29 October 2008, Tennant announced that he would be stepping down from the role after three full series.[26] He played the Doctor in four special episodes in 2009, before his final episode aired on 1 January 2010. The <em>Daily Mirror</em> reported that Tennant was forbidden from attending <em>Doctor Who</em> fan conventions while playing the role. This was done to avoid the chance that Tennant could accidentally let slip any plot points during filming of the series.[27]</p>
      <p>The BBC announced on 30 March 2013 that Tennant and Billie Piper will return to <em>Doctor Who</em> for the 50th anniversary special titled, "The Day of the Doctor" in late 2013, alongside current Doctor Matt Smith and companion Jenna-Louise Coleman (as the Eleventh Doctorand Clara Oswald, respectively).[28] In November 2013 he also appeared in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage <em>The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot</em></p>
